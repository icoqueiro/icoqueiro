# Ivan Coqueiro

🧬 I’m currently learning about Artificial Intelligence (AI) for healthcare on Coursera. I'm also working on improving my Java and C/C++ skills.

🎓 BSc in Biomedical Engineering and Science and Technology at Federal University of ABC, located in ABC Paulista in Brazil. 

🔬 During my graduation, I did an undergraduate research project based on alternatives for current FiO2 sensors. I also designed and implemented as a capstone project a Pushrim-Activated Power Assisted Wheelchair (PAPAW) instrumentation module.

🚀 I worked as a Tech Support intern during the year of 2023, where I developed important skills for Frontline employees.

🌐 I'm interested in participating in hackathons!
